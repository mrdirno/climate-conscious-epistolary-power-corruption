### Story Entry Points

- Write a letter from Elara to her sister Mara, explaining her decision after the first meeting, full of half-truths and omitted details.
- Compose Julian Thorne's journal entry from the night before he sent the initial invitation, outlining his calculus on Elara's usefulness and vulnerabilities.
- Draft the 'Friends of the Basin' internal memo that first identified Elara Voss's testimony as a potential asset or threat.
- Write a scene from the perspective of Armitage, the security lead, as he observes Elara's first week embedded with the Halcyon Group, noting her tells and adjustments.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build a dynamic, annotated map of the Lazarus Basin and Central Valley water allocations, allowing users to toggle between historical flows, current legal boundaries, and the proposed changes in the Act.
- Create an epistolary narrative engine: a web tool that lets users explore the story through discovered documents (letters, memos, texts, environmental reports) in a non-linear fashion, where the order of discovery changes the perceived narrative.
